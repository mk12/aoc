# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code] problems. They are mostly written in array programming languages like [J], [BQN], and [Uiua].

## Usage

See `./test.sh -h`:

```
usage: ./test.sh [-hd] PATTERN ...

Tests Advent of Code solutions. Runs files under src/ that match every PATTERN.
Runs all if no patterns are provided.

Options
    -h, --help   show this help message
    -d, --debug  debug mode and/or drop into a REPL
```
